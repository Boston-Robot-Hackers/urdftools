\begin{abstract}
The Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) \cite{urdf_ref} has long served as the canonical representation of robot models in the Robot Operating System (ROS2) \cite{ros2_ref}. Despite its widespread adoption, URDF suffers from verbosity, repetitive boilerplate, and hidden structural complexity. Xacro, an XML macro system, partially mitigates these issues but remains cumbersome and difficult to teach. We propose a YAML-based Domain-Specific Language (DSL) \cite{yaml_ref,dsl_ref} that compiles to URDF while offering flat syntax, explicit hierarchy declarations, smart defaults, and a template system. This approach reduces code size by approximately 60\% across representative case studies, improves readability, and enables self-contained robot descriptions. Our contribution is the first pure YAML replacement for URDF that combines conciseness with semantic clarity, designed to facilitate both technical development and educational onboarding. We present the design principles, implementation details, and comparative results, and discuss implications for the ROS2 community.
